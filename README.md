# Wikipedia Viewer
This web app was developed as one of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> intermediate front-end projects. The goal was to provide the user with a simple and intuitive way to either: Search for a Wikipedia article <strong>OR</strong> Read a random article.

This was achieved through a combination of CSS3 and jQuery for a responsive and animated design, and the MediaWiki API to pull the appropriate article information. The search bar design was heavily inspired by Vlad Georgescu at <a href="http://icanbecreative.com/article/css3-animated-search-box/" target="_blank">http://icanbecreative.com/article/css3-animated-search-box/</a>
